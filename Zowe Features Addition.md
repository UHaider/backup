# *Zowe Features Addition*

## Description
Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today. Zowe currently has limited capabilities and has room for many applications/plugins. The focus of this project would be to create new applications/plugins for Zowe.  

A few candidate applications I'm considering are:

* *File Transfer Application Drop Box Support* as mentioned on waffle https://waffle.io/zowe/community/cards/5b97ae28ee478e001e107c55.   
* Sending the code for compilation and getting the output back on the application.   
* Notification service that intercepts events on z/OS and creates Mac / Windows style notification on the desktop (similar to what you get in TSO)  
* IPL Explorer - interacts with z/OS to determine boot parms and allow for editing of Parmlib members wither through the included editor or via TN3270 (using Zowe Recognizer framework)

## Additional Information
